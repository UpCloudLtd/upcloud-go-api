# Releasing

1. Merge all your changes to the stable branch
2. If releasing a new major version, ensure that package name has been updated.
3. Push `credentials/v*` tag (e.g., `credentials/v1.0.0`) to the repository.

Do **NOT** create a new release to the repository as this is not the main module provided by this repository.
